Smoker V Doctor

This is a "Game Jam" project for the Global Game Jam.

This code is NOT final, but development will not continue. 
All of this code was made in 48 hours with little sleep and 
a lot of caffiene. 

The code is messy, and poorly designed. 
But it's mine, and the rough outline of the game is there. 

For a better overview of the Global Game Jam and our game in particular

go to that link for a copy of the executable and runnable file of
this game.
